# README FOR MICOM PARTITIONING TOOLS
# 
# short intro on how to use the tool
#
# 1) COMPILE THE PROGRAM
# make sure you include the path to the netcdf library
# also load the following modules
# on FRAM
#module load ifort/2019.1.144-GCC-8.2.0-2.31.1
#module load netCDF-Fortran/4.4.4-intel-2018a-HDF5-1.8.19
#on NIRD
module load netCDF-Fortran/4.6.0-iimpi-2022a

# then build
sh build.sh

# RUN PARTIT
./partit
# the program will wait for user input
# -number_of_tiles_in_Y_direction, -number_of_tiles_in_X_direction, -number_of_overlapping_cells_between_the_tiles
# a reasonable first guess is 
-8,-10,2
# 0.25 paleo grid: -32,-128,2 ; -32,-64,2;  -4,-128,2 #these (supposedly) work
# -10,-12,2 # seems promising
# -6,-60,2 # this seems promising
#-12,-15,2 #this does not work


# RUN TOPO_PPM
./topo_ppm
# this will produce a fort.31 file, which is actually a png image
# showing the tiles on a map, view it with display
display fort.31
